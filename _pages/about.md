I am a PhD student in the [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/), working with [Claire Vernade](https://www.cvernade.com/) at the [University of T端bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/).
I am interested in theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL).

Before coming to T端bingen, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at the Sapienza University of Rome.

I am also part of the organization of [T端bingen Women in Machine Learning](https://tuewiml.github.io).
